Read Me.

1. Please copy the file apriori.cpp from “CPP files” folder to the “Data” folder and run the following command:

2. g++ -o apriori apriori.cpp OR gcc apriori.cpp -lstdc++ -o apriori
then type ./apriori in command line.

3. All the inputs are compliant to the description provided in e-class page for assignment 2.

4. stats.txt in stats_* folder contains all the execution time and number of frequent item sets and strong association rules for 100, 1000 and 10,000 datasets.

5. Attached is the strong_rules.txt for all strong rules for 10000 (actually 9949) transactions.

6. Code references: I used some functions written by Stackoverflow (SO) users and I credited them (by putting the SO web url and their name) just before the respective functions in my .cpp files. 

7. apriori.cpp will always create strong_rules.txt and stats.txt for testing purpose.
